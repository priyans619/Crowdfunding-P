## Create the project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template
```

And start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app,
this is necessary for [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

## Setup
To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/priyans619/Movie-mania
   ```

2. Change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd Movie-mania
    ```

3. Install the dependencies
   
     ```shell
     npm install / npm i
      ```
4. Run the app
   
     ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

## ENJOY !!
